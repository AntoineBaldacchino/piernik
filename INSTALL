For typical desktop installation you may need to add few packages to be able to compile and run Piernik.

For Ubuntu try:
    sudo apt install git make libhdf5-mpich-dev libfftw3-dev pkg-config
You may use libhdf5-openmpi-dev if you prefer to.

For Fedora try:
    sudo dnf install hdf5-mpich-devel fftw-devel python environment-modules
    sed -i 's/specs=[^ ]*//' $( which h5pfc )
    module load mpi
You may use hdf5-openmpi-devel if you prefer to.
The "specs=..." settings are problematic because they're not installed via dependencies
and they may degrade the peformance of the code.

Then make sure that you've forked Piernik project on GitHub and in a directory of your choice do:
    git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/piernik
