For typical desktop installation you may need to add few packages to be able to compile and run Piernik.

For Ubuntu try:
    sudo apt install git make libhdf5-mpich-dev libfftw3-dev pkg-config
You may use libhdf5-openmpi-dev if you prefer to.

For Fedora try:
    sudo dnf install make hdf5-mpich-devel fftw-devel python environment-modules
    sudo sed -i 's/-specs=[^ ]*//g' /usr/lib64/mpich/bin/h5pfc
    module load mpi
The line "module load mpi" is worth putting in your .profile so you won't have to remember it.
You may use hdf5-openmpi-devel if you prefer to.
The "specs=..." settings are problematic because they're not installed via dependencies
and they may degrade the peformance of the code. If you don't like such hack or you
prefer to work with "hardening" and "fortyfying" features, then do:
    sudo dnf install redhat-rpm-config

Then make sure that you've forked Piernik project on GitHub and in a directory of your choice do:
    git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/piernik
