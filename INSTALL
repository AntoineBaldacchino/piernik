For typical desktop installation you may need to add few packages to be able to compile and run Piernik.

For Ubuntu try:
    sudo apt install git make libhdf5-mpich-dev libfftw3-dev pkg-config
You may use libhdf5-openmpi-dev if you prefer to.

Then make sure that you've forked Piernik project on GitHub and in a directory of your choice do:
    git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/piernik
