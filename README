Piernik development branch ‚cresp_development_mh’ 
created to plug in the cosmic ray energy spectrum module (cresp)
(read: „Cosmic Ray Energy SPectrum”)
into Piernik code.

The cresp module is designed to model energy dependent CR transport module 
based on a Focker-Planck equation solver by Miniati’s 
(Computer Physics Communications 141, 2001, 17–38) 
COSMOCR, enhanced with our own improvements and extensions.
