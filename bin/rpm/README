The meta-package piernik-mpich2-0-fedora.noarch.rpm contains dependencies on
everything that is necessary for compiling Piernik setups on a Fedora 17 and
later.  To install an environment for using the Piernik code on a Fedora,
use the following command (or equivalent):

sudo yum localinstall piernik-mpich2-0-fedora.noarch.rpm

It is possible to use this meta-package on Fedora 16, but some problems must
be resolved manually.  Since r5385 the Piernik code requires HDF5 libraries
>= 1.8.8 which aren't availabe in main Fedora 16 repositories.  You may
compile this library manually, or use rawhide source packages.  In the
second case, the following commands might be helpful.  It might be necessary
to install rpmbuild, rawhide repositories and some additional -devel
packages to fulfill requirements.  Note that version numbers may change in
the future.

yumdownloader --source --enablerepo=rawhide-source hdf5-mpich2-devel
rpm -Uvh hdf5-1.8.8-6.fc17.src.rpm
rpmbuild -bb rpmbuild/SPECS/hdf5.spec
yum localinstall rpmbuild/RPMS/i686/hdf5-mpich2{,-devel}-1.8.8-6.fc16.i686.rpm

The gfortran compiler available in Fedora 15 (based on gcc 4.6.x) may fail
to compile some Piernik setups due to internal compiler errors.  Use of such
old Linux distribution is thus strongly discouraged.
