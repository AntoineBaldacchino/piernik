The meta-package piernik-mpich2-0-fedora.noarch.rpm contains dependencies on
everything that is necessary for compiling Piernik setups on a Fedora 15 and
later.  To install an environment for using the Piernik code on a Fedora,
use the following command (or equivalent):

sudo yum localinstall piernik-mpich2-0-fedora.noarch.rpm 
 
Since r5385 the Piernik code requires HDF5 libraries >= 1.8.8 which aren't
availabe in main Fedora 16 repositories.  You may compile this library
manually, or use rawhide source packages.  In the second case, the following
commands might be helpful.  It might be necessary to install rpmbuild,
rawhide repositories and some additional -devel packages to fulfill
requirements.  Note that version numbers may change in the future.

yumdownloader --source --enablerepo=rawhide-source hdf5-mpich2-devel
rpm -Uvh hdf5-1.8.8-6.fc17.src.rpm
rpmbuild -bb rpmbuild/SPECS/hdf5.spec
yum localinstall rpmbuild/RPMS/i686/hdf5-mpich2{,-devel}-1.8.8-6.fc16.i686.rpm
