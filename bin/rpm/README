The meta-package piernik-mpich2-0-fedora.noarch.rpm contains dependencies on
everything that is necessary for compiling Piernik setups on a Fedora 16
(probably also on some earlier versions as well).  To install an environment
for using the Piernik code on a Fedora, use the following command (or
equivalent):

sudo yum localinstall piernik-mpich2-0-fedora.noarch.rpm
