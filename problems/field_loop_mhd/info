The two-dimensional magnetic field loop advection test problem is implemented to PIERNIK following
Journal of Computational Physics 229 (2010) 2117â€“2138, Mignone. A, Tzeferacos. P, Sec. 4.4. Such
an implementation can also be found in the PLUTO code.

A weak magnetic field loop is advected in a uniform velocity field. As the total pressure is
dominated by the thermal component, the magnetic field is transported as a passive scalar.
The robustness of the scheme is tested by its ability to preserve the initial circular shape
of the loop.

The box size is given by (x, y):([-1,1],[-0.5,0.5]) discretized on (N_x,N_x/2) grid cells,
where N_x=128. At the initial instant density and pressure are set to 1. The flow velocity
is defined as

    \vec{V} = (v0*cosalpha,v0*sinalpha)

where v0 = \sqrt(5), cosalpha = 2/\sqrt(5) and sinalpha=1/sqrt(5). The magnetic field is defined
through the vector potential as

    A_z = A0*(R - r) if r <= R
        = 0          if r > R

where A0 = 10^-3, R = 0.3, and r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.

Periodic boundary conditions are used in both the directions.
